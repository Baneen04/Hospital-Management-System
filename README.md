# Hospital-Management-System
The Hospital Management System is a comprehensive software solution developed in C++ utilizing various data structures and algorithms to efficiently manage hospital operations. This system is designed to facilitate the management of patient records, doctor appointments, medical histories, and billing information.

The system encompasses several key features that enhance hospital administration. Patient management allows for the addition, updating, and retrieval of patient information, including personal details, medical history, and current treatments. Appointment scheduling is streamlined with functionalities to book, modify, and cancel appointments, ensuring efficient time management for both doctors and patients. The system also includes a module for managing doctorsâ€™ schedules and specializations.

One of the core components of the Hospital Management System is its use of advanced data structures and algorithms to ensure optimal performance and data handling. The system employs linked lists, queues, stacks, and binary search trees to manage and organize data efficiently. This ensures quick access to patient records, fast scheduling operations, and effective data storage.

The billing module of the system manages the financial aspects, including patient billing, payment processing, and generating invoices. It ensures accurate and transparent billing practices, enhancing the hospital's financial management.

To set up the Hospital Management System, clone the repository from GitHub and compile the source code using a C++ compiler. Ensure that the development environment is set up with the necessary libraries and dependencies. The system is designed to be user-friendly, with a simple command-line interface that guides users through various operations.

The project is open for contributions, and collaboration is encouraged to improve the system further. Contributions can include optimizing algorithms, adding new features, or enhancing the user interface.
